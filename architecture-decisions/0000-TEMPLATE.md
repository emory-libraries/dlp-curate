## Context
This section should outline the reason we are making a decision. It should include any assumptions as well.
Additionally, ADR writers should consult
http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions for additional guidance.

## Decision
The context sets up the problem, and this section lays out the solution. It may take multiple paragraphs to go
into enough detail.

## Consequences
By now, this ADR has a problem and solution. Here, it will also describe the affect the ADR should have, and
other impacts the solution does not address directly.

## Alternatives
This section briefly outlines the alternatives we could have taken, with PRO's and CON's.

### This is an alternative.
Here is it's description. Sections like this should repeat as necessary.
- PRO: A reason we considered this alternative
- CON: A reason we did not accept this alternative.
