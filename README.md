# Database Authentication

In a production environment, we will use Shibboleth for authentication. However, in a development environment we will be using a local database.

In order to set up your dev environment for database authentication, you will need to set the following environment variable:

`export DATABASE_AUTH=true`

# Local Development Setup

Run each of the following commands in a separate tab within the `dlp-curate` directory:

1. Setup local Solr instance by running command `solr_wrapper`
2. Setup local Fedora instance by running command `fcrepo_wrapper`
3. Setup local app server by running command `rails server`
4. Access the app through `http://localhost:3000/`

Refer to the Hyrax local development [guide](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/v3.4.2/documentation/developing-your-hyrax-based-app.md) for more information regarding installing additional tools like Fits and ImageMagick, which are needed to enable file uploads.

# Testing and CI

To run the tests locally, run each of the following commands in a separate tab within the `dlp-curate` directory:

1. Setup local Solr testing instance by running command `solr_wrapper --config config/solr_wrapper_test.yml`
2. Setup local Fedora testing instance by running command `fcrepo_wrapper --config config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml`
3. Run `rspec` and verify that all tests pass


A second option, which has not been working consistently for local testing, is running the test suite with `bin/rails ci`.

For our CI we are using CircleCI that we adopted from hyrax project: [Hyrax CircleCI Config](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)

# Caching manifests with localhost

In a development environment, rake task creates and caches manifests with
`base_url` as `localhost:3000`.

In order to run the rake task locally and see cached manifests properly,
please use port 3000 with localhost.
