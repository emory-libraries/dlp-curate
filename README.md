# Database Authentication

In a production environment, we will use Shibboleth for authentication. However, in a development environment we will be using a local database.

In order to set up your dev environment for database authentication, you will need to set the following environment variable:

`export DATABASE_AUTH=true`

# Local Development Setup

Run each of the following commands in a separate tab within the `dlp-curate` directory:

1. Setup local Solr instance by running command `solr_wrapper`
2. Setup local Fedora instance by running command `fcrepo_wrapper`
3. Setup local app server by running command `rails server`
4. Access the app through `http://localhost:3000/`

Refer to the Hyrax local development [guide](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/v3.4.2/documentation/developing-your-hyrax-based-app.md) for more information regarding installing additional tools like Fits and ImageMagick, which are needed to enable file uploads.

# Deployment

1. Connect to `vpn.emory.edu`
2. Pull the latest version of `main`
3. Stub AWS' environment variables for `Emory Account 70` within the same terminal window. These can be found in the page loaded after logging into [Emory's AWS](https://aws.emory.edu). Directions below:
  a. After logging in, the page should be the `AWS access portal`. A table of multiple accounts should be presesnt (typically three). Expand the `Emory Account 70` option.
  b. Clicking on `Access keys` will open a modal with multiple credential options. Option 1 (`Set AWS environment variables`) is necessary for successful deployment.
  c. Copy the variables in Option 1, paste them into the terminal window that the deployment script will be processed, and press enter.
5. To deploy, run `BRANCH={BRANCH_NAME_OR_TAG} bundle exec cap {ENVIRONMENT} deploy`. To deploy main to the arch environment, for instance, you run `BRANCH=main bundle exec cap arch deploy`.

## Deployment Troubleshooting

If errors occur when running the deployment script, there could be a couple of factors causing them:
- Ensure you are authorized to access the server you are deploying to. You can verify your access by trying to ssh into the server e.g. `ssh deploy@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`.
- The server IP lookup processing may not be working. In this case, stub the backup environment variables for the desired server in the local `.env.development` file. The list of backup environment variables are below:

```
ARCH_SERVER_IP=
TEST_SERVER_IP=
PROD_SERVER_IP=
```

# Testing and CI

To run the tests locally, run each of the following commands in a separate tab within the `dlp-curate` directory:

1. Setup local Solr testing instance by running command `solr_wrapper --config config/solr_wrapper_test.yml`
2. Setup local Fedora testing instance by running command `fcrepo_wrapper --config config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml`
3. Run `rspec` and verify that all tests pass


A second option, which has not been working consistently for local testing, is running the test suite with `bin/rails ci`.

For our CI we are using CircleCI that we adopted from hyrax project: [Hyrax CircleCI Config](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)

# Caching manifests with localhost

In a development environment, rake task creates and caches manifests with
`base_url` as `localhost:3000`.

In order to run the rake task locally and see cached manifests properly,
please use port 3000 with localhost.
